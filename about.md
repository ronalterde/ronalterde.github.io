Hi, I'm Steffen. I create embedded software for a living. I always strive to improve the quality of my code by studying new methods, paradigms and technologies. Besides that, I enjoy fine-tuning my text editor, low-level microcontroller programming, the Linux OS and of course playing around with my home espresso machine.

Iâ€™m a Software developer for embedded devices at Rohde & Schwarz Germany. This blog is about my private projects though, opinions are my own.
