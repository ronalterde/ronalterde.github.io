title: 'Thoughts on Python from a C++ developer''s viewpoint: Class members'

<p>In this series of articles I will present some random things I've noticed when I started studying the Python programming language a while ago. I'm actually not very experienced in the language yet, as I don't get in touch with it that often. But I think if you also do your programming mainly in C++ and tend to use Python now and then, this might be for you.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>This article is about <em>class members</em>. When I wrote my first Python class, I started off just as usual -- by creating a class and putting in some methods and member variables.</p>
<p>Everything went fine up to the moment I realized that all instances of that class happened to <strong>share the same internal state</strong>. After some research on the web, I've found a perfect example from the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#class-and-instance-variables">Python docs</a>, so let's just take a look at it.</p>

{% highlight python %}
class Dog:
    tricks = []
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    def add_trick(self, trick):
        self.tricks.append(trick)
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        d = Dog('Fido')
        e = Dog('Buddy')
        d.add_trick('roll over')
        e.add_trick('play dead')
        print(d.tricks)
        print(e.tricks)
{% endhighlight %}

<p>On execution, the output is the following:</p>
{% highlight python %}
['roll over', 'play dead']
['roll over', 'play dead']
{% endhighlight %}

<p>As we can see, both class instances apparently share a single instance of the <em>tricks</em> list and operate on it.</p>
<p>The docs also state the solution to the problem, of course. Instead of declaring the <em>tricks</em> list inside the class, we simply assign the desired initial value to <em>self.tricks</em> at the first usage:</p>
{% highlight python %}
class Dog:
    def __init__(self):
        self.tricks = []
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Why did I even consider writing <em>tricks = []</em> in the first place, you might ask. I think that idea arouse from the corresponding C++ notation:</p>
{% highlight cpp %}
class Dog {
public:
	void addTrick(const std::string& trick) {
		tricks.push_back(trick);
	}
private:
	std::vector<std::string> tricks;
};
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Here, the class attribute always needs to be declared explicitly.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In Python, there is no need to declare instance members explicitly. We simply write <em>self.foo</em> at first usage.</p>
<p>I the subsequent episodes of the series, I will probably write about the interactive Python interpreter, the style guide and some other interesting topics. Feel free to contact me on twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/ronalterde">@ronalterde</a>.<br />
