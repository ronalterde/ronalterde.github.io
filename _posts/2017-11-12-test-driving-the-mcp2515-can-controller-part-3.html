  bus'

<p>In this episode of the series we are going to focus a bit more on the target hardware. The driver code created during the <a href="https://steffen.ronalter.de/2017/10/15/test-driving-the-mcp2515-can-controller-part-2/">previous</a> two episodes is going to be compiled for the target microcontroller and programmed into flash memory. While it's only the <em>reset</em> functionality of the MCP2515 we can verify right now, I think it's a step into the right direction.</p>
