<p>In this second article of the series on Python we're going to cover some really great features of the interactive interpreter. We'll see that a full-fledged debugger may not even be necessary to get serious work done in Python.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Python (usually) comes with an interactive interpreter that supports executing your code one line after another -- just like the shell does. This Read-Eval-Print-Loop (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop">REPL</a>) evaluates your input as soon as you press ENTER.</p>
<p>Consider a short example how this might look like after firing up the the interpreter <em>python3</em> on the shell:<br />
{% highlight python %}
>>> for i in range(5):
...  print(i)
...
0
1
2
3
4
>>>
{% endhighlight %}
<p>We can also import an existing module - this is where it gets really interesting for prototyping and debugging. Consider the following script:</p>
{% highlight python %}
""" demo.py """
def foo():
    print('foo')
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Let's now import that module from the interactive interpreter and call <em>foo()</em> on it:
{% highlight python %}
>>> import demo
>>> demo.foo()
foo
>>>
{% endhighlight %}

<p>What if we now change some part of the original source file and call <em>foo()</em> again?</p>
{% highlight python %}
""" demo.py """
def foo():
    print('bar')
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight python %}
>>> demo.foo()
foo
>>>
{% endhighlight %}

<p>As we can see, the module contents are not reloaded automatically. So let's fix that by using <em>importlib</em>:</p>
{% highlight python %}
>>> import importlib
>>> importlib.reload(demo)
>>> demo.foo()
bar
>>>
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Isn't that great? We can develop a module in a step-by-step manner, being able to test its behavior from the interpreter immediately. This works best if we keep functions and classes decoupled from each other inside modules. As a side effect, this might even lead to improved designs.</p>
<p>Another neat feature: <a href="http://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/readline/rluserman.html#SEC22">readline vi mode</a> is supported. Let's try this by putting the following into your <em>~/.inputrc</em>:<br />
{% highlight bash %}
set editing-mode vi
set keymap vi
set show-mode-in-prompt on
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Now the Python interpreter prompt shows a <em>+</em> sign at the beginning of each line to signalize insert mode. It will change to <em>:</em> in normal mode:<br />
{% highlight bash %}
$ python3
+>>> 
:>>>
{% endhighlight %}

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The interactive interpreter seems to be a great tool for debugging and prototyping. What else do you think would be interesting to talk about? Just contact me on twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/ronalterde">@ronalterde</a>.</esc></p>
