<p>Today's blog article is about how to <em>optimize the power consumption</em> of an AVR microcontroller running on batteries.</p>
<p>We're going to explore one of the ATmega32's sleep modes and how it affects power consumption. We will eventually reach a state where it actually makes sense to power the device from batteries. Besides sleeping, the microcontroller should do some work for us, requested by a single button press.</p>
